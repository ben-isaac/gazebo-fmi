# This setup-example.sh file can be source (via the command source <location-of-the-file>/setup-example.sh)
# to append to the GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH the location of the installed gazebo-fmi plugins, and to
# GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH the location of the installed examples .world and .fmu, so that examples
# world can be launched directly from the terminal, via the command gazebo  <example-world>.word .
# For more info on Gazebo related env variables, chec http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=components#EnvironmentVariables .

# Load directory that contains the Gazebo plugins

# Load directory with example worlds and directory with fmus
export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=$GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH:@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@GAZEBO_FMI_EXAMPLES_INSTALL_DIR@
